> My notepad for the Haskell From First Principles book

At the moment, this is not really useful to anyone besides myself.

If you are looking for solutions to the exercises, I would recommend getting the repos with the same idea but more stars/contributors.

If at some point I believe this has a value to someone but me, I will update this file with usefull information.

**Beware** that the exercises are targeting the `1.0RC3` version of the book, with the latest version available of GHC. There are solutions that differ from the expected from the book because of that (mainly because of the Semigroups/Applicatives recent changes).
